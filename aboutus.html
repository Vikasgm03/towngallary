      <h3>👋 Hi, I'm Vikas G M</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate developer from <strong>Shravanabelagola</strong> 🇮🇳 — the land of culture, hills, and peace.
        I created this project, <strong>"Namma Shravanabelagola"</strong>, to showcase the beauty of our hometown —
        from scenic spots to local temples and the friendly faces that make it special.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to help everyone explore and appreciate the rich heritage of Shravanabelagola through this digital gallery.
        Each photo and location here represents a story — of people, faith, and community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Built with ❤️ using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> — this website is designed and developed entirely by me.
      </p>
